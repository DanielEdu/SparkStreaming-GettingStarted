# _Spark-Streaming-Template-Lite_
A barebones project with scala, apache spark built using sbt. Spark-shell provides `spark` and `sc` variables pre-initialised.

## Prerequisites
- [Java 1.8](https://java.com/en/download/)
- [Scala 2.11.12](https://www.scala-lang.org/)
- [sbt 1.3.12](https://www.scala-sbt.org/)

## Build and Demo process

- `clean`	Deletes all generated files (in the target directory).
- `compile`	Compiles the main sources (in src/main/scala and src/main/java directories).
- `test`	Compiles and runs all tests.
- `console`	Starts the Scala interpreter with a classpath including the compiled sources and all dependencies. To return to sbt, type :quit, Ctrl+D (Unix), or Ctrl+Z (Windows).
- `run <argument>*`	Runs the main class for the project in the same virtual machine as sbt.
- `package`	Creates a jar file containing the files in src/main/resources and the classes compiled from src/main/scala and src/main/java.
- `help <command>`	Displays detailed help for the specified command. If no command is provided, displays brief descriptions of all commands.
- `reload`	Reloads the build definition (build.sbt, project/*.scala, project/*.sbt files). Needed if you change the build definition.
